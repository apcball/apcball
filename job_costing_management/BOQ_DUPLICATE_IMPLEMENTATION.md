# BOQ Duplicate Implementation Summary

## Issue Description
The user reported that when duplicating a BOQ (Bill of Quantities), the product fields in the BOQ lines were becoming blank in the copied BOQ.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was occurring because Odoo's default `copy()` method for One2many fields (like `line_ids`) doesn't always properly copy Many2one relationships like `product_id`. This is a common issue in Odoo when dealing with complex models with nested One2many relationships.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced BOQ Model Copy Method
**File:** `/opt/instance1/odoo17/custom-addons/job_costing_management/models/boq.py`

- **Override `copy()` method in BOQ model** to handle proper duplication:
  - Generate new BOQ name and title with "(Copy)" suffix
  - Reset state to 'draft' and clear approval fields
  - Clear template reference to avoid conflicts
  - Manually copy categories first to maintain relationships
  - Manually copy each BOQ line with explicit field mapping
  - Ensure all Many2one relationships (product_id, uom_id, category_id) are properly copied
  - Reset line status to 'pending' for new BOQ
  - Clear requisition and cost line relations (they shouldn't be copied)

### 2. Enhanced BOQ Line Copy Method
**File:** `/opt/instance1/odoo17/custom-addons/job_costing_management/models/boq.py`

- **Override `copy()` method in BOQLine model** to ensure proper copying:
  - Clear requisition and cost line relations
  - Reset status to 'pending'
  - Preserve all other field values

### 3. Enhanced BOQ Template Copy Method
**File:** `/opt/instance1/odoo17/custom-addons/job_costing_management/models/boq.py`

- **Override `copy()` method in BOQTemplate model** to handle template duplication:
  - Generate new template name with "(Copy)" suffix
  - Manually copy template lines with proper field mapping
  - Ensure product_id and uom_id are properly copied

### 4. Enhanced BOQ Template Line Copy Method
**File:** `/opt/instance1/odoo17/custom-addons/job_costing_management/models/boq.py`

- **Override `copy()` method in BOQTemplateLine model** for completeness

### 5. Added Duplicate Action Method
**File:** `/opt/instance1/odoo17/custom-addons/job_costing_management/models/boq.py`

- **Added `action_duplicate()` method** to BOQ model:
  - Calls the enhanced copy method
  - Returns action to open the new duplicated BOQ

### 6. Added Duplicate Button to UI
**File:** `/opt/instance1/odoo17/custom-addons/job_costing_management/views/boq_views.xml`

- **Added "Duplicate" button** to BOQ form view header:
  - Calls the `action_duplicate()` method
  - Available on all BOQ records regardless of state
  - Styled as secondary button

### 7. Added Duplicate Action Window
**File:** `/opt/instance1/odoo17/custom-addons/job_costing_management/views/boq_views.xml`

- **Added `action_boq_duplicate`** action record for potential future use

## Key Features of the Implementation

### 1. **Proper Field Copying**
- All Many2one relationships are explicitly copied by ID
- Product, UOM, and Category relationships are preserved
- All text fields, numbers, and other field types are copied correctly

### 2. **Relationship Management**
- Categories are copied first and mapped to new BOQ
- BOQ lines reference the correct new categories
- Requisition and cost line relations are intentionally not copied (they're specific to the original BOQ)

### 3. **State Management**
- New BOQ starts in 'draft' state
- Approval fields are cleared
- Line statuses are reset to 'pending'
- Template reference is cleared to avoid conflicts

### 4. **User Experience**
- Clear indication that BOQ is a copy (title suffix)
- Duplicate button easily accessible in form view
- New BOQ opens automatically after duplication

### 5. **Debugging Support**
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- Debug information shows line count and product copying status

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create a test BOQ** with multiple lines containing different products
2. **Test duplication** using the "Duplicate" button
3. **Verify** that all product fields are properly copied
4. **Check** that categories are correctly mapped
5. **Confirm** that the new BOQ is in 'draft' state
6. **Validate** that requisition relations are not copied

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. Open any BOQ record
2. Click the "Duplicate" button in the header
3. The system will create a copy and open it automatically
4. Review the copied BOQ to ensure all data is correct

### For Developers:
- The `copy()` method can be called programmatically: `new_boq = boq.copy()`
- Additional default values can be passed: `new_boq = boq.copy({'project_id': other_project.id})`
- The `action_duplicate()` method provides a user-friendly interface

## Benefits

1. **Solves the blank product issue** - Products are now properly copied
2. **Maintains data integrity** - All relationships are preserved
3. **Provides flexibility** - Users can easily duplicate BOQs for similar projects
4. **Improves workflow** - Reduces manual data entry for similar BOQs
5. **Ensures consistency** - Copied BOQs start in the correct state

## Backward Compatibility
- The implementation is fully backward compatible
- Existing BOQ records are not affected
- Standard Odoo copy functionality is preserved where appropriate
- No database schema changes required

## Update Log

### Issue Resolution - January 2025
- **Fixed XML parsing error**: Removed deprecated `view_type` field from `ir.actions.act_window` in BOQ views
- **Added duplicate button**: Successfully added "Duplicate" button to BOQ form header
- **Enhanced error handling**: Improved copy method with better error handling and logging
- **Added test wizard**: Created test wizard to verify BOQ duplication functionality

### Current Status: âœ… RESOLVED
The BOQ duplication functionality is now working correctly with the following features:
- Products are properly copied in BOQ duplicates
- All relationships (categories, UOM, etc.) are preserved
- Duplicate button is available in the BOQ form view
- Test wizard available for verification

This implementation completely resolves the issue of blank products in BOQ duplicates while providing a robust and user-friendly duplication system.
