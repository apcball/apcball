  - Adjusted Quantity = Quantity × (1 + Waste%)
  - Adjusted Total Cost = Total Cost × (1 + Waste%) × (1 + Contingency%)

### 3. Material Requisition Workflow
- **BOQ to Requisition Process**:
  1. Select BOQ lines for requisition
  2. System creates material requisition
  3. Automatic population of quantities and costs
  4. Approval workflow (Employee → Department → Manager)
  5. Purchase order or internal transfer generation

### 4. Template System
- **Template Management**:
  - Create reusable templates by job type
  - Standard item specifications
  - Quick project setup from templates
  - Template versioning and updates

### 5. Reporting and Analytics
- **BOQ Reports**:
  - Professional PDF reports
  - Category-wise breakdown
  - Waste and contingency analysis
  - Cost summaries and totals
