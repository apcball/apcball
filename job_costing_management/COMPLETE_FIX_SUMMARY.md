# Complete Fix Summary - Job Costing Management Module

## Issues Resolved

### 1. XML Syntax Error âœ…
**Problem**: Incomplete XML tag `<fil` causing lxml parsing error
**Solution**: 
- Fixed incomplete filter tag in search view
- Added proper closing tags (`</data>` and `</odoo>`)
- Completed job cost line action definition

### 2. OWL Directive Error âœ…
**Problem**: Forbidden OWL directive `t-esc` in form view
