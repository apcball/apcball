### 3. Bulk Operations
- **Cost Type Update Wizard**: Change cost types for multiple lines
- **Bulk Edit Wizard**: Update multiple fields simultaneously
- **Multi-select Support**: Tree view supports multiple selection
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of bulk operations

### 4. Validation and Security
- **Constraint Validation**: Prevents incompatible product-cost type combinations
- **Access Control**: Proper permissions for users and managers
- **Mail Tracking**: Change history for important fields
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and validation

### 5. Navigation and Usability
- **Multiple Access Points**: Menu, smart buttons, edit buttons
- **Search and Filters**: Advanced filtering by cost type, variance, etc.
- **Grouping Options**: Group by cost sheet, cost type, product
- **Real-time Calculations**: Automatic total and variance updates

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### Models Enhanced
- `models/job_cost_sheet.py`: Added mail tracking, validation methods, navigation actions

### Views Created
- `views/job_cost_sheet_views.xml`: Added job cost line views and enhanced existing views

### Wizards Added
- `wizard/job_cost_line_wizard.py`: Cost type update and bulk edit wizards
- `wizard/job_cost_line_wizard_view.xml`: Wizard form views

### Menu Updates
- `views/job_costing_menu.xml`: Added job cost lines menu item

### Demo Data
- `demo/job_cost_line_demo.xml`: Sample cost lines for testing

### Documentation
- `JOB_COST_LINE_EDITING_GUIDE.md`: Comprehensive user guide
- `test_job_cost_line_editing.py`: Test script for validation

### Configuration
- `__manifest__.py`: Updated to include new files
- `wizard/__init__.py`: Added wizard imports

## üéØ Key Features for Users

### Problem Solved: Cost Type Editing
- **Before**: Users couldn't easily change cost types or edit individual cost lines
- **After**: Full editing capability with validation and bulk operations

### Main Use Cases Addressed
1. **Correcting Cost Type Mistakes**: Easy cost type changes with validation
2. **Bulk Updates**: Efficient editing of multiple cost lines
3. **Individual Line Management**: Detailed editing with related record tracking
4. **Data Integrity**: Automatic validation prevents data inconsistencies

### User Benefits
- **Time Saving**: Bulk operations reduce manual work
- **Error Prevention**: Validation prevents incompatible combinations
- **Better Visibility**: Enhanced views show all related information
- **Flexibility**: Multiple ways to access and edit cost lines

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Model Inheritance**: Extended existing models without breaking changes
- **Wizard Pattern**: Used for bulk operations to maintain clean separation
- **Domain Filtering**: Dynamic product domains based on cost type
- **Computed Fields**: Real-time calculations for totals and variances

### Security
- **Existing Groups**: Leveraged current security groups
- **Record-level Access**: Inherits from job cost sheet permissions
- **Validation Constraints**: Database-level validation for data integrity

### Performance
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized for bulk operations
- **Computed Fields**: Stored computations for better performance
- **Minimal Overhead**: No impact on existing functionality

## üöÄ Ready for Use

The implementation is complete and ready for production use. Users can now:

1. **Edit individual cost lines** through multiple access points
2. **Change cost types** with automatic validation
3. **Perform bulk operations** efficiently
4. **Track changes** through mail integration
5. **Maintain data integrity** through validation

All functionality has been tested and documented for easy adoption by end users.
