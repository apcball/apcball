## Internal Transfer Location Fix

### Problem
The `action_create_picking` method in `material_requisition.py` had an issue where the `location_dest_id` was not properly set in the stock move lines, causing errors when creating internal transfers.

### Solution
Enhanced the `action_create_picking` method with:

1. **Improved Location Logic**: 
   - Better handling of destination location assignment
   - Proper fallback to default locations when employee/department locations are not set
   - Added error handling for missing locations

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Try-catch blocks for external references that might not exist
   - Graceful fallback to search for available locations
   - Clear error messages for users

3. **Better Stock Move Creation**:
   - Fixed direct assignment of `location_dest_id` in move lines
   - Ensured both source and destination locations are properly validated
   - Added return action to show the created picking

### Code Changes
```python
# Before (problematic)
'location_dest_id': picking_vals['location_dest_id'],

# After (fixed)
'location_dest_id': dest_location,
```

### Additional Improvements
- Added comprehensive location validation
- Enhanced error messages for better user experience
- Added fallback location search logic
- Improved return action to show created picking

## Impact
This fix ensures that internal transfers created from material requisitions will work correctly without location-related errors, providing a robust solution for stock movement operations.

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Create a material requisition with internal transfer lines
2. Click "Create Internal Transfer" button
3. Verify the stock picking is created successfully
4. Check that stock move lines have proper source and destination locations

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - Internal transfer creation now works correctly with proper location assignment and error handling.
