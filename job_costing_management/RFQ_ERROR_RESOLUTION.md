# RFQ Layout Fix - Error Resolution

## ❌ Error Encountered
```
ParseError: Element '<xpath expr="//group[@name='header']">' cannot be located in parent view
```

## 🔧 Root Cause
The original header layout fix was trying to replace a group element that doesn't exist in the purchase order form view with the exact name `header`.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Problematic View
Removed the `view_purchase_order_header_layout_fix` record that was causing the parsing error.

### 2. Kept Essential Modifications
The main improvements requested by the user are already implemented in the `view_purchase_order_form_job_costing` view:

#### ✅ Hidden Job Costing Fields in Header:
```xml
<field name="material_requisition_id" readonly="1" invisible="1"/>
<field name="job_cost_sheet_id" readonly="1" invisible="1"/>
<field name="project_id" readonly="1" invisible="1"/>
<field name="job_order_id" readonly="1" invisible="1"/>
```

#### ✅ Job Cost Fields in Order Lines:
- Job Cost Center field with proper domain
- Job Cost Line field with filtering
- Set as `optional="hide"` to hide by default
- Full functionality preserved

## 📋 Current Status

### What Works Now:
1. ✅ **Hidden Job Costing Fields**: No longer clutter the RFQ header
2. ✅ **Job Cost Integration**: Available in order lines when needed  
3. ✅ **Clean Interface**: Simplified RFQ header layout
