# RFQ Layout Improvements - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Changes Made to RFQ/Purchase Order Views

### 🔧 Issues Fixed

#### 1. Duplicate Contact Person Fields
**Problem**: Contact Person field appeared twice in RFQ form
**Solution**: Created header layout fix view to reorganize fields properly

#### 2. Hidden Job Costing Fields  
**Problem**: Job Cost Sheet, Project, Job Order fields cluttered header
**Solution**: Made these fields invisible (invisible="1") while keeping functionality

#### 3. Uneven Field Layout
**Problem**: Left and right field groups were not evenly distributed
**Solution**: Reorganized header fields into balanced left and right groups
