# XML Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. XML Syntax Error
**Problem**: Incomplete XML tag `<fil` on line 452 in `job_cost_sheet_views.xml`
**Solution**: Completed the filter tag and added proper closing structure

### 2. Missing Closing Tags
**Problem**: Missing `</data>` and `</odoo>` closing tags
**Solution**: Added proper XML file closure

### 3. Missing Job Cost Line Action
**Problem**: Job cost line action was referenced but not defined
**Solution**: Added complete action definition with proper help text

### 4. Invalid Action References
**Problem**: Tree view buttons referenced non-existent actions using `%(action_job_cost_line)d`
**Solution**: Replaced with object method calls `action_edit_cost_line`

## Files Fixed

### job_cost_sheet_views.xml
- Fixed incomplete filter tag
- Added missing closing tags
