- Updated module dependencies
- Added "base" as a dependency for stability

### 2. Payment Register Wizard
- Added compatibility layer for `source_amount_currency` field
- Updated currency conversion methods for Odoo 17
- Added error handling to prevent crashes
- Enhanced `_compute_amount()` method with try-catch blocks
- Added `_get_source_amount()` method for backward compatibility

### 3. View Files
- Simplified view inheritance to avoid conflicts
- Added WHT fields as invisible to ensure availability
- Updated xpath expressions for better compatibility
- Fixed withholding tax code income views by removing non-existent fields

### 4. Currency Conversion
- Added compatibility for new currency conversion methods
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for older methods
- Enhanced error handling for currency operations

### 5. Model Updates
- Added missing `withholding_tax_code_income` model
- Updated field definitions with proper currency_field
- Enhanced error handling in all models
- Fixed field references in views

### 6. View Fixes
- Removed `is_default` field from withholding tax code income views
- Added proper field definitions for all models
- Enhanced form and tree views for better usability

### 7. Error Handling and Record Safety
- Added comprehensive error handling to prevent "Missing Record" errors
- Implemented record existence checks using `.exists()` method
- Added try-catch blocks around all critical operations
- Graceful fallbacks for deleted or non-existent records
- Enhanced stability for concurrent operations

### 8. Payment Wizard Enhancements
- Fixed "Missing Record" errors in batch payment processing
- Added error handling for payment register wizard methods
- Enhanced stability for multi-invoice payments with WHT
- Improved error logging for debugging purposes
- Graceful fallbacks for currency conversion failures

## Installation

1. Place the module in your Odoo 17 addons directory
2. Update the app list
3. Install the module from Apps menu

## Usage

### Withholding Tax on Payments
1. Create vendor bills with withholding tax lines
2. Register payment - the system will automatically calculate WHT deduction
3. The payment amount will be reduced by the withholding tax amount
4. Withholding tax certificates can be generated from payments

### Personal Income Tax (PIT)
1. Configure PIT rates in Accounting > Configuration > Personal Income Tax
2. Create withholding tax with PIT flag enabled
3. Use in vendor bills for individual vendors
4. System calculates progressive tax rates automatically

### Withholding Tax Code Income
1. Access via Accounting > Configuration > WHT Income Code
2. Configure income codes for different types of withholding tax
3. Codes are used in withholding tax certificates

## Fixed Issues
- ✅ Module installation errors resolved
- ✅ View inheritance conflicts fixed
- ✅ Field reference errors corrected
- ✅ Currency conversion compatibility added
- ✅ Payment register functionality restored
- ✅ Missing Record errors prevented with comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Record existence checks added to all critical methods
- ✅ Graceful error handling for deleted or non-existent records
- ✅ Batch payment "Missing Record" errors fixed
- ✅ Payment wizard stability enhanced for concurrent operations
- ✅ Reconciliation AttributeError fixed (NoneType object has no attribute 'get')
- ✅ Safe payment creation with fallback mechanisms

## Known Issues
- WHT fields are currently invisible in payment register form (functional but not visible)
- To make fields visible, custom view modifications may be needed

## Support
For issues specific to Odoo 17 compatibility, please check:
1. Currency conversion methods
2. Field dependencies
3. View inheritance conflicts

## Technical Notes
- The module uses compatibility layers to work with both old and new Odoo APIs
- Error handling has been enhanced to prevent module crashes
- Fallback mechanisms ensure functionality even if some methods are not available
- All view field references have been validated against model definitions

## Testing

The module includes comprehensive tests to verify the fixes:

```bash
# Run specific tests for missing record handling
odoo-bin -d your_database -i l10n_th_account_tax --test-enable --test-tags test_missing_record_handling

# Run all module tests
odoo-bin -d your_database -i l10n_th_account_tax --test-enable
```

## Troubleshooting

For detailed troubleshooting information, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

Common issues and solutions:
- Missing Record errors in batch payments
- Currency conversion compatibility
- View inheritance conflicts
- Field reference errors

## Performance Impact

The error handling improvements have minimal performance impact:
- Record existence checks are fast operations
- Try-catch blocks only activate on errors
- Logging is conditional and optimized

## Migration from Previous Versions

1. Backup your database before upgrading
2. Test in staging environment first
3. Monitor logs for any warnings
4. Verify WHT calculations remain accurate
5. Test batch payment processing thoroughly
