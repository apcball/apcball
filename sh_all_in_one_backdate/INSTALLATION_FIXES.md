# Installation Fixes Applied

## Issue Fixed
The module installation was failing with the error:
```
Field 'allow_backdate' used in modifier 'invisible' (not allow_backdate) must be present in view but is missing.
```

## Root Cause
The view files were using the `allow_backdate` field in the `invisible` attribute of buttons, but the field was not included in the form views. Odoo requires all fields used in view modifiers to be present in the view.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated View Files
Added the `allow_backdate` field as an invisible field to all document form views:

- **account_move_views.xml**: Added field after `name` field
- **account_payment_views.xml**: Added field after `date` field  
- **sale_order_views.xml**: Added field after `date_order` field
- **purchase_order_views.xml**: Added field after `date_order` field
- **stock_picking_views.xml**: Added field after `scheduled_date` field
- **account_bank_statement_views.xml**: Added field after `date` field

### 2. Created Missing View File
- **views/backdate_log_views.xml**: Created comprehensive views for the backdate log model including tree, form, search views and menu items

### 3. Updated Manifest
- Fixed module name (removed "buz" prefix)
- Added `backdate_log_views.xml` to the data files list
- Reordered data files for proper loading sequence

## Result
The module should now install successfully without view-related errors. All backdate buttons will be properly visible/hidden based on the `allow_backdate` field value.

## Next Steps
1. Install the module from the Apps menu
2. Configure settings in Settings > General Settings
3. Assign user permissions
4. Add an icon file at `static/description/icon.png` (128x128 PNG)

## Testing
After installation, verify:
- Backdate buttons appear on posted documents for authorized users
- Wizard opens correctly when clicking backdate buttons
- Settings page is accessible and functional
- Backdate logs are created and viewable
