ICON PLACEHOLDER

Please place a 128x128 PNG icon file named "icon.png" in this directory.

The icon should represent the backdate functionality, such as:
- A calendar with a back arrow
- A clock with reverse arrow
- A document with date modification symbol

You can create or download an appropriate icon and save it as:
sh_all_in_one_backdate/static/description/icon.png

This will be used as the module icon in the Odoo Apps menu.
